		and the Florida Panhandle.  In the past 16 years, I have represented several brands from MasterBrand 
		Cabinets and serviced different channels of distribution.  I am proud that I have consistently 
		represented one industry leading manufacturer with portfolio of products that best meet my customer’s 
		needs.  Since 1997, we have expanded and have taken on more channels and brands for MasterBrand Cabinets 
		and we have taken on more geography.  We are now also responsible for servicing Mississippi, Kentucky, 
		Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia &amp; West Virginia
 for certain channels of distribution and MasterBrand product offerings.</font></p>

		achieve your business goals that we will succeed along with you. I focus on my customer's success and 
		profitability, not just product! At Todd Haley &amp; Associates, we can help you develop marketing and
