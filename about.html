                    Hello! Thank you for visiting my web site. For the last 20 years, I have been involved in the kitchen 
		industry as a partner in a kitchen dealership and as a sales rep working directly for a manufacturer. 
		With this knowledge and experience, I started a multi-line agency in 1997 serving Georgia, Alabama, 
		and the Florida Panhandle.  In the past 16 years, I have represented several brands from MasterBrand 
		Cabinets and serviced different channels of distribution.  I am proud that I have consistently 
		represented one industry leading manufacturer with portfolio of products that best meet my customer’s 
		needs.  Since 1997, we have expanded and have taken on more channels and brands for MasterBrand Cabinets 
		and we have taken on more geography.  We are now also responsible for servicing Mississippi, Kentucky, 
		Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia &amp; West Virginia
 for certain channels of distribution and MasterBrand product offerings.</font></p>

		achieve your business goals that we will succeed along with you. I focus on my customer's success and 
		profitability, not just product! At Todd Haley &amp; Associates, we can help you develop marketing and 
		business plans as well as sales plans.</font></p>

                    would appreciate the opportunity to help you in any way. Give
